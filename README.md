# C+- programming language
## The purpose of creating a language
The C+- programming language is being developed as an individual project
within the framework of the course "Programming in the Kotlin language" of
the Saint Petersburg Electrotechnical University «LETI». The goal of the project
is to study the principles of programming languages, the main stages of code
translation and the operation of the JVM.

## Basic provisions
The C+- programming language should:
* Translated into bytecode and executed on a JVM.
* Support a static type system and a procedural programming paradigm.
* Support all basic arithmetic operations.
* Support conditional statements.
* Support <for> and <while> loops.

## Realized opportunities
At the moment, the language has implemented:
* Declaring variables of type int32 and float32
* Simple assignment operations, on the right side of which there must be necessarily two numbers, or a number and a 
variable, or two variables linked by an arithmetic sign.

At the end of the program, all variables, their types and their values are displayed.
